## Summary

7 Days to Die Mod: add Hydroponics features inspired by [Midnight's Hydroponics Mod](https://7daystodiemods.com/midnights-hydroponics/).

## Features

This crafting mod introduces the `Hydroponics Wick` and `Hydroponics Rack` as new ways to craft (grow) crops indoors.

| Recipe             | How To Unlock       | Crafted At      | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Hydroponic Wick    | Workstations lvl 30 | Workbench       | Workstation used to produce Small Crop Bundles      |
| Hydroponic Rack    | Workstations lvl 30 | Workbench       | Workstation used to produce Large Crop Bundles      |
| Water Reservoir    | Workstations lvl 30 | Workbench       | Component used in constructing Hydroponic Wick/Rack |
| Water Line         | Workstations lvl 30 | Workbench       | Component used in constructing Hydroponic Wick/Rack |
| Grow Light         | Workstations lvl 30 | Workbench       | Component used in constructing Hydroponic Wick/Rack |
| Fertilizer         | Not Locked          | Cement Mixer    | Component used in crafting (growing) Crop Bundles   |
| Small Crop Bundles | Not Locked          | Hydroponic Wick | Unpackable collection of 120 crops                  |
| Large Crop Bundles | Not Locked          | Hydroponic Rack | Unpackable collection of 288 crops                  |

> - Crafting your own `Hydroponic Wicks` and `Racks` will unlock at `Workbench Level 30`, making this more of a mid-game feature.
> - `Cement Mixer` recipe is also learned at `Workstations lvl 30`, which will be necessary for composting `Fertilizer`.
> - `Fertilizer` and crop bundle recipes are intentionally unlocked for all players at the beginning of the game, which makes it possible to tend to a friend's Hydroponic stations even at a very low level.
> - `Small` and `Large Crop Bundles` take 1 hour of real-world time to craft.
> - The ratio of seeds-to-crops is a consistent 1:6, making this a better exchange rate for inexperienced farmers, but not as good for max level `Living Off the Land` farmers with full Farmer gear.

### Benefits

- simple management; no manual labor!
- great exchange rate of 1:6 seeds-to-crops in the early-mid game
- safe from snipers on PVP servers
- no need to plan an above-ground farm

### Drawbacks

- no benefits received from `Living Off the Land` or Farmer's gear
- exchange rate of 1:6 seeds-to-crops can be beaten with the right skill level in `Living Off the Land` and a full set of Farmer's gear
- added overhead of having to craft `Fertilizer` can build up over time (rotting flesh, potassium nitrate, and bones are fairly easy to gather but can be hard to farm consistently over time)

## Compatibility

| Environment          | Compatible | Does EAC Need to be Disabled? | Who needs to install? |

| Dedicated Server     | Yes        | no                            | only server           |
| Peer-to-Peer Hosting | Yes        | no                            | only host             |

## Acknowledgements

- Much thanks to `Midnight` for her awesome idea and original implementation of a Hydroponics mod in 7 Days to Die!
  - This mod is inspired by her mod and includes a different approach; be sure to also [check out what Midnight made](https://7daystodiemods.com/midnights-hydroponics/) since you might prefer her mod over this one.
