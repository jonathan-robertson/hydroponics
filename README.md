### Support

💟 This mod has reached its end of life and is no longer supported or maintained by Kanaverum ([Jonathan Robertson](https://github.com/jonathan-robertson) // me). I am instead focused on my own game studio ([Calculating Chaos](https://calculatingchaos.com), if curious).

The code in this project isn't perfect; as you update, add features, fix bugs, and otherwise improve upon my ideas, please make sure to give yourself credit for the work you do and publish your new version of the mod under your own name :smile: :tada:

## Features

This crafting mod introduces the `Hydroponics Wick` and `Hydroponics Rack` as new ways to craft (grow) crops indoors.

| Recipe             | How To Unlock       | Crafted At      | Description                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Hydroponic Wick    | Workstations lvl 30 | Workbench       | Workstation used to produce Small Crop Bundles      |
| Hydroponic Rack    | Workstations lvl 30 | Workbench       | Workstation used to produce Large Crop Bundles      |
| Water Reservoir    | Workstations lvl 30 | Workbench       | Component used in constructing Hydroponic Wick/Rack |
| Water Line         | Workstations lvl 30 | Workbench       | Component used in constructing Hydroponic Wick/Rack |
| Grow Light         | Workstations lvl 30 | Workbench       | Component used in constructing Hydroponic Wick/Rack |
| Fertilizer         | Not Locked          | Cement Mixer    | Component used in crafting (growing) Crop Bundles   |
| Small Crop Bundles | Not Locked          | Hydroponic Wick | Unpackable collection of 120 crops                  |
| Large Crop Bundles | Not Locked          | Hydroponic Rack | Unpackable collection of 288 crops                  |

> - Crafting your own `Hydroponic Wicks` and `Racks` will unlock at `Workbench Level 30`, making this more of a mid-game feature.
> - `Cement Mixer` recipe is also learned at `Workstations lvl 30`, which will be necessary for composting `Fertilizer`.
> - `Fertilizer` and crop bundle recipes are intentionally unlocked for all players at the beginning of the game, which makes it possible to tend to a friend's Hydroponic stations even at a very low level.
> - `Small` and `Large Crop Bundles` take 1 hour of real-world time to craft.
> - The ratio of seeds-to-crops is a consistent 1:6, making this a better exchange rate for inexperienced farmers, but not as good for max level `Living Off the Land` farmers with full Farmer gear.

### Benefits

- simple management; no manual labor!
- great exchange rate of 1:6 seeds-to-crops in the early-mid game
- safe from snipers on PVP servers
- no need to plan an above-ground farm

### Drawbacks

- no benefits received from `Living Off the Land` or Farmer's gear
- exchange rate of 1:6 seeds-to-crops can be beaten with the right skill level in `Living Off the Land` and a full set of Farmer's gear
- added overhead of having to craft `Fertilizer` can build up over time (rotting flesh, potassium nitrate, and bones are fairly easy to gather but can be hard to farm consistently over time)
